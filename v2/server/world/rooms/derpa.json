        "examine": "A sprawling laboratory with ceiling-mounted holographic displays showing research data. Half-built prototypes sit on workbenches. In the center, a massive mechanical eye on a chrome arm extends from the ceiling - that's Gladyce. She's currently examining a circuit board, her lens clicking as it focuses. The walls are covered in whiteboards filled with equations, diagrams, and notes like 'TEST THIS!' and 'BRILLIANT IDEA!'",
        "enter": "You step into the DERPA Lab. Immediately, a massive eyeball on a robotic arm swivels toward you and zooms in uncomfortably close to your face. 'Oh! A visitor! *iris dilates* Welcome to DERPA! I'm Gladyce! What brings you to Research & Development?' The eye is now 4 inches from your nose."
